# 2026_lld_by_ishan

A structured repository for **Low-Level Design (LLD) practice**, focusing on
**SOLID principles** and **Design Patterns** using Java.

This repository is intended for:
- Strengthening LLD fundamentals
- Interview preparation
- Practicing clean, extensible object-oriented design
- Building reusable design pattern references

## SOLID Principles

The `solid-principles` module contains focused examples demonstrating:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open–Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Each principle is demonstrated using:
- Simple, readable Java examples
- Before/after refactors where applicable
- Emphasis on reasoning and trade-offs

---

## Design Patterns

The `design-patterns` module covers classical design patterns grouped into:

### Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms.
Examples include:
- Singleton
- Factory / Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns
Focus on object composition and relationships.
Examples include:
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Facade
- Composite
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects.
Examples include:
- Strategy
- Observer
- Command
- State
- Chain of Responsibility

Each pattern is implemented using:
- Clear problem statements
- Practical use cases
- Clean, minimal Java code
- Emphasis on *why* the pattern exists, not just *how*

---

## Design Philosophy

- Favor **clarity over cleverness**
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**
- Keep examples **self-contained**
- Highlight **design trade-offs**
- Avoid over-engineering

This repository prioritizes **learning value** over production completeness.

---

## Language & Tools

- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven (where applicable)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Style:** Plain Java (no frameworks unless required)

---

## Intended Audience

- Software engineers preparing for LLD interviews
- Developers revisiting object-oriented design fundamentals
- Anyone looking for clean, minimal design pattern references

## Notes

This is an **evolving repository**.  
Content will grow organically as more principles and patterns are added.
