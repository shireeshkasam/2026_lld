# Decorator Design Pattern

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside
special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

- **Attaches additional responsibilities** to an object **dynamically**.
- Provides an alternative for sub-classing i.e. extending functionality.
- It changes one form to another form.
- Inheritance is not for code reuse or sharing behavior, in-fact it is composition that allows you to share behavior.
